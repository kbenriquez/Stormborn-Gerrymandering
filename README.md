# Stormborn-Gerrymandering
This application shows the effects of Gerrymandering on the districts of the entirety of the United States
with the use of an interactable map where users can merge districts and create their own superdistricts. Tests
are conducted for every district to determine whether the district was gerrymandered, and if so, how much.

This repository is solely intended to display the Front-End side of our project. The Back-End and the database
are not included in this repository. Features not included are:

- information for each states and districts displayed on mouseover
- varying information for states and districts depending on year selected
- creating superdistricts by merging 2 or more districts (this follows superdistricing laws depending on the state)

The Stormborn Gerrymandering app was developed by Salvatore Termine, Miraj Alam, Samuel McKay and Kyle Marcus Enriquez
for our CSE308 Software Engineering course at Stony Brook University.
